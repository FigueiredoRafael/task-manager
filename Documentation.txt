        3. A colaborator can't work more than 2 Sundays (sundayRule) per month.

        $colaborator = [];
        $colaborator [
            nome: jo達o,
            CPF: 123.123.123-00,
            email: joaosilva123@gmail.com,
            dayShift: '', // Can't be more than 2 per day
            weekShifts: '', // Can't be more than 11 per week
            sundayRule: '', // Can't be more than 2 per month
        ]
        $morningShift = 0; // Can't be more than 1 task per shift
        $afternoonShift = 0; // Can't be more than 1 task per shift
        $eveningShift = 0; // Can't be more than 1 task per shift

        $colaboratorSwap = ''; // This will receive by the POST method which colaborator the person wants to swap with.

        Table for Swapping

        Has access => Database ['username']


        $task = [
            taskTitle = 'Clean Sector 3 - Morning',
            conclusionDate = 'Tuesday (Date)',
            taskResponsible = '$colaborator',
            taskDescription = '',
            taskStatus = ''
        ]

        Logic for the 2nd Rule:

        if ($colaborator['dayShifts'] > 2) {
            $print_r = 'Deu ruim, n達o pode';
        } else {
            ++$colaborator['dayShifts'];
        }

        Logic for the 3rd Rule:

        if ($colaborator['weekShifts'] > 11) {
            $print_r = 'Deu ruim, n達o pode';
        } else {
            ++$colaborator['weekShifts'];
        }

        Logic for the 4th Rule:

        if ($colaborator['sundayRule'] > 2) {
            $print_r = 'Deu ruim, n達o pode';
        } else {
            ++$colaborator['sundayRule'];
        }
